			From high school, to college, all the way to the NFL, football is the largest and most popular sport in the United States. There are over one million students who participate in high school football, nearly twice the amount who participate in the next most popular sport, track and field.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text' style='margin-bottom: 40px;'>
		<p>
			Football is also arguably the most dangerous sport in the country. There are nearly three times as many injuries in high school football then in any other sport. Former NFL players have shortened life spans along with a reduced quality of life. And most jarringly, even though it is recognized that high school sports are the safest they have ever been, over twelve high school football players die every year.

			It is telling that men who have reached the highest level of fame and success in the sport openly acknowledge that football is not a path that they would willingly allow their loved ones to pursue. Something must change in order to protect the children playing this sport.

			According to a study done by the University of North Carolina, two-thirds of all football related deaths (high school, college, semi-pro) between 1931–2014 occurred at the high school level. Head trauma and heat illness are the leading causes of death amongst these players. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text'>
		<p>
			Most deaths related to heat stroke occur during preseason workouts. Two-a-days, practicing twice in the same day, have been called risky by experts. These practices often occur during the hottest months of the year and players are oftentimes not acclimated to the heat and amount of strenuous activity. Two-a-days are prohibited in the NFL and heavily regulated at the college level. However, in high school, they are still fairly common, especially in southern states.

			Second impact syndrome (SIS) occurs when a previously concussed person suffers another brain injury before the first one completely heals. This can lead to severe brain swelling and is oftentimes fatal. Teenagers are at a much greater risk of suffering from SIS&mdash;all documented cases, outside of boxing, have occured in adolescents.

		<p>
			The average life span for men in the United states is 78.7 years. However, the life expectancy for men who have played in the National Football League drops dramatically to just 55 years. Therefore, NFL players are expected to die nearly 24 years younger based on their chosen profession. Along with a much shorter life span, former NFL players are five times more likely to develop any form of mild cognitive impairment. They are also four times more likely to die from Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease) or Alzheimer’s Disease.

			Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease that is found in people who have suffered repetitive brain trauma. 91 deceased former NFL players of various ages have allowed their brains to be examined by scientists. 87 of them tested positive for CTE, which is 96% of the sample.

			CTE, along with Alzheimer’s, ALS, and dementia, are common diagnoses among former NFL players, They are often diagnosed with early-onset versions, which means they develop symptoms at a much younger age. These diseases have symptoms ranging from mild memory loss to complete loss of motor skills.
