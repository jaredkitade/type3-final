		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			From high school, to college, all the way to the NFL, football is the largest and most popular sport in the United States. There are over one million students who participate in high school football, nearly twice the amount who participate in the next most popular sport, track and field.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text' style='margin-bottom: 40px;'>
		<p>
			Football is also arguably the most dangerous sport in the country. There are nearly three times as many injuries in high school football then in any other sport. Former NFL players have shortened life spans along with a reduced quality of life. And most jarringly, even though it is recognized that high school sports are the safest they have ever been, over twelve high school football players die every year.

			<h4>High School Football Fatalities</h4>
		<p>
			According to a study done by the University of North Carolina, two-thirds of all football related deaths between 1931&ndash;2014 occurred at the high school level. The study classifies each player's death as either a direct or indirect fatality.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text'>
		<p>
			Direct fatalities are &ldquo;fatalities which resulted directly from participation in the fundamental skills of football.&rdquo; These include injuries such as spine fractures or head trauma.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text'>
		<p>
			Indirect fatalities are &ldquo;fatalities that are caused by systemic failure as a result of exertion while participating in a football activity.&rdquo; These include illnesses such as heat stroke or complications from another football related injury.

			Most deaths related to heat stroke occur during preseason workouts. Two-a-days (practicing twice in the same day) have been called risky by experts. These practices often occur during the hottest months of the year and players are oftentimes not acclimated to the heat and amount of strenuous activity. Two-a-days are prohibited in the NFL and heavily regulated at the college level. However, in high school, they are still fairly common, especially in southern states.

		<h4>Injuries and Long-Term Effects</h4>
		<p>
			 Over the past five years, over 3.39 million injuries have been reported by high school athletes playing football. The next closest sport, girl's soccer, has 1.19 million, nearly two thirds less. In total, football accounts for nearly half of all reported injuries in high school sports.

			 All injuries, no matter how serious, can have lasting effects on a person's long-term health. Torn knee ligaments can lead to cartilage degeneration throughout the injured leg, not just the knee. Former NFL players suffer from severely decreased mobility because of aches and pains caused by injuries sustained during their careers.
	</div>
	<div class='body-text' style='margin-bottom:80px;'>
		<p>
			 Minor injuries add up as well; even if a player never suffers a concussion, there is still a risk for long-term damage. These minor collisions are called repetitive head impacts (RHI). High school players routinely experience around 150 RHI&rsquo;s per week. Research has shown that players who experience a large amount of RHI&rsquo;s have more impaired memory than those who are suffering from a concussion.

		<h4>Brain Disease and NFL Players</h4>
		<p>
			The average life span for men in the United states is 78.7 years. However, the life expectancy for men who have played in the National Football League drops dramatically to just 55 years. Therefore, NFL players are expected to die nearly 24 years younger based on their chosen profession.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text'>
		<p>
			Along with a much shorter life span, former NFL players are five times more likely to develop any form of mild cognitive impairment. They are also four times more likely to die from Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease) or Alzheimer’s Disease.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class='body-text' style='margin-bottom: 40px';>
		<p>
			A 2009 study done by the University of Michigan revealed that former NFL players between the ages of 30 and 49 were being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 19 times more often than the general population. These former players are also four times more likely to die from Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou&nbsp;Gehrig’s Disease).

			Football is an inherently violent sport&mdash;there is simply no way to guarantee a player&rsquo;s safety. However, there are ways to minimize the risk of danger and prevent these teenagers from dying. There is no reason for over fifteen kids to die each year from playing the sport.

			Learning the proper tackling technique decreases the risk of injury for both players involved in the collision. Always keep your head up when going for a tackle. Initiating contact with your head facing down can cause spinal damage, potentially leading to paralysis. Former NFL defensive back Bobby Hosea runs a camp that focuses strictly on tackling with your head up, something that all youth camps should include.

			 Following practice guidelines is a must in order to keep players safe. Eliminating two-a-days, at least until players have become acclimated to the condtions, would decrease the risk of heat stroke. Young athletes are particularly vulnerable during the first couple weeks of camp because they are not always prepared for the heat and training intensity.
		</p>
	</div>
		<div class='body-text'>
		<p>
			 Most importantly, young athletes need to speak up when something feels wrong. Not reporting a head injury can be extremely dangerous, especially for high school players’. This is because teenagers' brains are still developing and even more vulnerable to long term effects.

			There needs to be an increased awareness surrounding the dangers in high school football. Fifteen teenagers die every year playing this game, which is unnacceptable. Precautions must be taken. This is not about banning football, it is about saving these players' lives.
